## 1. Sarah - The Solo Developer

### Profile
- **Role:** Freelance Rails Developer
- **Experience:** 4 years with Rails, 6 years total development
- **Team Size:** Works alone on 3-5 client projects simultaneously
- **Tech Stack:** Rails 6/7, PostgreSQL, Heroku/DigitalOcean

### Background
Sarah juggles multiple client projects, often switching between them several times a week. She maintains both greenfield applications and legacy codebases. Working solo means she's responsible for everything from feature development to deployment.

### Goals & Motivations
- Deliver features quickly without breaking production
- Maintain a clean development workflow across projects
- Minimize time spent debugging migration issues
- Build trust with clients through reliable deployments

### Migration Pain Points
- **Context Switching:** Forgets which migrations belong to which feature when switching between projects
- **Branch Pollution:** Accidentally commits migrations from one feature branch to another
- **Production Surprises:** Discovers orphaned migrations only after deploying to staging/production
- **Manual Tracking:** Relies on memory or scattered notes to track migration states
- **Rollback Confusion:** Unsure which migrations are safe to rollback when switching branches

### Key Scenarios
1. **Monday Morning Chaos:** Returns to a project after a week, can't remember which migrations were for the feature branch
2. **Emergency Fix:** Needs to hotfix production but has uncommitted migrations in development
3. **Client Demo Prep:** Must ensure staging environment matches the feature branch exactly
4. **Branch Cleanup:** Accumulated migrations from abandoned feature experiments

### How Rails-Migration-Guard Helps
- **Automatic Tracking:** No need to manually track which migrations belong to which branch
- **Clear Status Reports:** `rails migration_guard:status` instantly shows migration state
- **Safe Branch Switching:** Warnings prevent accidentally carrying migrations between branches
- **Confident Deployments:** Pre-deployment check ensures no orphaned migrations
- **Quick Recovery:** Easy rollback of branch-specific migrations
