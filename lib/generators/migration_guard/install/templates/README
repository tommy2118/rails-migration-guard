Rails Migration Guard has been successfully installed!

Next steps:

1. Run the migration to create the migration_guard_records table:
   
   rails db:migrate

2. Review and customize the configuration in:
   
   config/initializers/migration_guard.rb

3. The following commands are now available:

   rails db:migration:status         # Show migration status
   rails db:migration:rollback_orphaned  # Roll back orphaned migrations
   rails db:migration:check          # Check for migration issues

4. To track migrations automatically, they will be monitored when you run:
   
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:rollback
