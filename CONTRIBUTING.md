## Development Process

### 1. Issue Creation and Assignment

- All work should be tracked via GitHub Issues
- Check if an issue already exists before creating a new one
- Use appropriate issue templates
- Wait for issue to be triaged and labeled before starting work

### 2. Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:
- `feature/issue-number-brief-description` for features
- `fix/issue-number-brief-description` for bug fixes
- `docs/issue-number-brief-description` for documentation

Examples:
- `feature/42-add-slack-integration`
- `fix/13-namespaced-migration-rollback`
- `docs/7-troubleshooting-guide`

### 3. Commit Messages

Follow these commit message guidelines:

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat(reporter): add colorized output support

- Add Rainbow gem for cross-platform color support
- Make colors configurable via config.colorize_output
- Respect NO_COLOR environment variable
- Add specs for color output

Closes #3
```

### 4. Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** for any changed functionality
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass** locally
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes under "Unreleased"
5. **Reference the issue** in your PR description using "Closes #issue-number"
6. **Request review** from maintainers

**PR Title Format:**
```
[Issue #123] Brief description of changes
```

### 5. Code Review

- All PRs require at least one approval
- Address all feedback comments
- Keep PRs focused on a single issue
- Be open to suggestions and feedback

## Style Guides

### Ruby Style Guide

We follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/) with these specifications:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use double quotes for strings
- Add frozen string literal comment to all Ruby files
- Keep methods under 15 lines
- Keep classes under 150 lines

Run RuboCop to check your code:
```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```

### RSpec Style Guide

- Use `describe` for methods and `context` for conditions
- Use `let` and `let!` instead of instance variables
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Aim for >90% test coverage

Example:
```ruby
RSpec.describe MigrationGuard::Reporter do
  let(:reporter) { described_class.new }
  
  describe "#orphaned_migrations" do
    context "when migrations exist only locally" do
      it "identifies migrations not in trunk" do
        # test implementation
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use YARD documentation for all public methods
- Include usage examples in documentation
- Keep README concise but comprehensive
- Update documentation in the same PR as code changes

## Project Management

### Issue Labels
